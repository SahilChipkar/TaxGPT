> **TaxGPT** is a Streamlit-based chatbot that provides real-time Chain-of-Thought streaming for tax-related queries.  
> It uses LangChainâ€™s RetrievalQA chain with an optional local PDF knowledge base to generate answers with internal reasoning.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Chain-of-Thought Streaming**  
  The internal reasoning is streamed into a dropdown expander titled **"Chain of Thought"** (with `<think>` and `</think>` tags removed).

- **Real-Time Final Answer**  
  Tokens after the closing `</think>` tag are streamed as the final answer in real time.

- **Local PDF Knowledge Base (Optional)**  
  Provide a local **TAX.pdf** file in the project root. The app processes the PDF using PDFPlumberLoader and splits it into chunks for retrieval.

- **Clean Conversation History**  
  Only the final answer is stored in the conversation history to keep the chat concise.
